# pr.pl v0.0.3

`prpl` exposes simple PCRE stream processing to the CLI. It is intended as a **barebone, primitive** substitute for `grep`, `sed` and `awk`.

## Usage

```prpl [-v] PATTERN [file, file...]```

`prpl` takes a PCRE match or substitution pattern as the first param, and optionally a list of files. If no files are passed, `prpl` will process `STDIN`. If no modifiers are needed, the closing delimiter may be omitted.

`prpl` process input line-by-line and will always print results to `STDOUT`.

`prpl` is case sensitive, by default.

#### Matching

`prpl` will run a match operation if the regular expression supplied is prefixed with an `m`, like so: `m/prpl/`. The leading `m` may be omitted, as `prpl` performs matching by default.

Running a match operation will return only matching lines. Matches can be inverted with the `-v` option.

This will print all lines in the file `README.md` that contain the test "prpl":

```bash
$ prpl '/prpl/' README.md
```

This will print out all files in the current directory with a `.PL` extension:

```bash
$ ls | prpl '/\.PL$/'
```

Using the `/i` modifier, this will run the same operation without case sensitivity:

```bash
$ ls | prpl '/\.PL$/i'
```

#### Inverting matches

This will print all files without the `.PL` extension, without case sensitivity:

```bash
$ ls | prpl -v '/\.PL$/i'
```

#### Replacing

`prpl` will run a replacement operation if the regular expression supplied is prefixed with an `s`, like so: `s/prpl/PRPL/`.

Modifiers, and closing delimiters are optional. The replacement is optional if the replacement is a **single** delete but not for **global** deletes: (`s/prpl` vs `s/prpl//g`);

Replacement operations will print all supplied lines, with substitutions applied.

This will print all lines in the file `README.md` replacing "prpl" with "PRPL" **once per line**:

```bash
$ prpl '/prpl/PRPL/' README.md
```
Using the `/g` modifier, this will print all lines in the file `README.md` replacing "prpl" with "PRPL" **for all appearances**:

```bash
$ prpl '/prpl/g' README.md
```

Inversion is not compatible with replacement operations. Attempting to do so will simply cause the input to pass through unmodified, with warnings generated to `STDERR`.

#### Running Perl Code

Replacements can use the `/e` modifier. This allows us to evaluate the replacement as per code before returning it.

The command below will take each file in a directory, and replace it with a file with a capitalize extension.

This command will run the perl `uc` function on the second matched group, and return the uppercase version of it. It also uses the `/x` modifier, which causes the regex enegine to ignore whitespace and make our expressions a little more readable:

```bash
$ ls -p | prpl -v 'm:\W$' | prpl 's/ (.+?) \. (.+) / "mv $1.$2 $1." . uc($2) /xe' | bash
```

#### Transliteration

Transliteration may be applied with the `y` prefix.

This will capitalize all lowercase characters passed in:

```bash
$ prpl 'y/a-z/A-Z/' README.md
```

Here's a simple ROT13 implementation:

```bash
$ prpl 'y/A-Za-z/N-ZA-Mn-za-m/' README.md
```

This will run the operation twice, returning the original text:

```bash
$ prpl 'y/A-Za-z/N-ZA-Mn-za-m/' README.md | prpl 'y/A-Za-z/N-ZA-Mn-za-m/'
```

Inversion is not supported for transliteration and will have the same result as an attempt to invert a substitution.

#### Alternate Delimiters

You can substitute characters like : or % to improve readability.

These are all the same command:

```bash
$ prpl /match/ README.md
$ prpl :match: README.md
$ prpl %match% README.md
```

#### Dropping the quotes

You don't explicitly NEED single quotes around your expression, unless you're using spaces or escapes. Single quotes will ensure your backslashes are preserved to the regex engine.

```bash
$ prpl /\w/ README.md    # prpl receives /w/
$ prpl '/\w/' README.md  # prpl correctly receives /\w/
```
```bash
$ prpl /\d{4}/   README.md  # prpl receives /d{4}/
$ prpl '/\d{4}/' README.md  # prpl correctly receives /\d{4}/
```

```bash
$ ls |  /\.md/  # prpl receives /.md/
$ ls | '/\.md/' # prpl correctly receives /\.md/
```

#### Shorthand

`prpl` will run a match if the regex supplied begins with a delimiter or an `m`.

You don't need to specify a closing delimiter for any operaion, unless you need modifiers.

Matches can be made very terse with these rules.

```bash
$ prpl ':e' README #Find all lines with lowercase e's.
```

### Testing 

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/endpoint.svg?url=https%3A%2F%2Factions-badge.atrox.dev%2Fseanmorris%2Fprpl%2Fbadge%3Fref%3Dmaster&style=flat-square)](https://actions-badge.atrox.dev/seanmorris/prpl/goto?ref=master)

Tests are automatically executed by github on push. Their status is reported by the badge directly above, as well as in the header of this README.

Tests & syntax checks are also automatically executed in a git pre-commit hook. The commit is rejected if any of these fail.

You can view the latest test output [here](https://actions-badge.atrox.dev/seanmorris/prpl/goto?ref=master).

`prpl` can compare its behavior with `grep` and `sed`. Just navigate to the test directory of the project and run `bash test.sh`.

You can add grep tests to `grepTests.txt`. They'll be tested for regex matech against a list of 77,022 American words. Please do not include delimiters here, as `grep` doesn't use them. They'll be added for `prpl.` `sed` tests should be supplied in similar form in `setTests.txt`, **with** their delimiters and leading `s`'s.
